# Hangman
Hangman is a classic game in which a player thinks of a word and the other player tries to guess that word within a certain amount of attempts.

This is an implementation of the Hangman game, where the computer thinks of a word and the user tries to guess it. 

## Milestone 1
In this milestone, I was able to set up GitHub. GitHub is a version control software used to keep track of project development. I installed GitHub, and created a repo that will host my project file remotely. This technique will enable me to work on different aspects of the same project independently and in the end merge them to have a complete project.

## Milestone 2
Yes, it is connected to the previous milestone. First, this README.md was part of the files I created while creating the repo. Second, I cloned the repo to my local machine which the same as downloading the repo before I started performing the required tasks. 

- I have imported random module and used the choice method to randomly select a fruit from my list of favorite fruits.

- I have run the python file I created on terminal. I used the code below to do that

```python milestone_2.py```

## Milestone 3
Here, I have created two functions using the key word 

```python def```

In one of the function, I have passed an argument used within the function. Also, I have imported another file (module) and call one of the variables defined in the imported file. 

## Milestone 4
In this milestone, I have created the Hangman ```class``` and defined different methods needed to complete the game. Methods are functions defined within the function. I also used the ```__init__()``` method to initiate the attributes of the class each time an instance of the class is created. Other methods that I created are ```ask_for_input``` and ```check_guess``` using the keyword ```def``` to definition them as functions within the ```Hangman``` class.
